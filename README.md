**Project Name:-** Binary Calculator

### DESCRIPTION :-  

  * This is the **Calculator for infinite numbers** which is implemented using _C Programming language_.
  * It tries to implement some functionalities from unix based command **'bc'**.
  * It can perform operations only on decimal numbers with arbitary length*
  
  ---
  * Operations performed on countably infinite length numbers are as follows:-
    * Addition
    * Substraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Modulus  
  ---
  * It evaluates the expression using **infix expression evaluation**
  * All expressions are evaluated according to their **_precedence_**.
