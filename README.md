**Project Name:-** Binary Calculator
(project under GNU public license , copyright reserved 2022 (SARVESH KULKARNI) )

### IMPORTANT :-
  * There are two branches in the repository : 
  * 1) Main Branch : This branch contains , the earlier project which can perform operations with normal number  (no decimals)
  * 2) BCUpgraded Branch : This branch contains , the newest project which can perform operations with decimal numbers.

### DESCRIPTION :-  

  * This is the **Calculator for countably infinite numbers** which is implemented using _C Programming language_.
  * It tries to implement some functionalities from unix based command **'bc'**.
  * It can perform operations only on decimal numbers with arbitary length*
  ---
  * Operations performed on countably infinite length numbers are as follows:-
    * Addition
    * Substraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Modulus
    * Power  
  ---
  * It evaluates the expression using **infix expression evaluation**
  * All expressions are evaluated according to their **_precedence_**.
  * _paranthesis_ '()' can be used which is having higher precedence.
  * Also multiple operators expressions are supported Eg : _(12-(-12)_*

##Terminologies Used : 

1)Operand and operator Stack
2)Linked list
3)ifndef directive
3)Macro
4)Different loops
5)Makefile in linux
6)Bash script 
7)Array
8)Pointers

  
### Execution Steps :-  

 * Clone the repository on your machine using git clone or downloading zip.
 * Open **Terminal** and _change directory_ to the project directory.  
 * Type command ' **make** ' which will compile the required files and generate _executable file_.  
 * Then type the command ' **./binaryCalculator** '.

  * If you want to read and understand the code , for simplicity start reading it from main -> addition -> subtraction -> multiplication -> division -> modulus -> power -> infixEvaluation
  * Feel free to test it on multiple valid test cases 
  * If you find any modifications,optimizations to the repository feel free to put a pull request or you can email me at sarvesh123305@gmail.com*
