**Project Name:-** Binary Calculator
(project by 2022 (SARVESH KULKARNI) )

### DESCRIPTION :-  

  * This is the **Calculator for countably infinite numbers** which is implemented using _C Programming language_.
  * It tries to implement some functionalities from unix based command **'bc'**.
  * It can perform operations only on decimal numbers with arbitary length*
  ---
  * Operations performed on countably infinite length numbers are as follows:-
    * Addition
    * Substraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division
    * Modulus
    * Power  
  ---
  * It evaluates the expression using **infix expression evaluation**
  * All expressions are evaluated according to their **_precedence_**.
  * _paranthesis_ '()' can be used which is having higher precedence.
  * Also multiple operators expressions are supported Eg : _(12-(-12)_

### Execution Steps :-  

 * Clone the repository on your machine using git clone or downloading zip.
 * Open **Terminal** and _change directory_ to the project directory.  
 * Type command ' **make** ' which will compile the required files and generate _executable file_.  
 * Then type the command ' **./binaryCalculator** '.
  

  ---
  * You can test it on multiple valid test cases*
  * If you find any modifications,optimizations to the repository you can put a pull request or you can email me the testcase at sarvesh123305@gmail.com I will correct it
